like
thumbnail.topAnchor( _: self.view.topAnchor , constant : 10).isActive = true // self.view.topanchor is not available  i dont know why but probably the class is not subclass of viewcontroller

740,Which Nietzsche book is he recommending at 4:12 ?,0,
741,"Hmm, is it easy to summarise or direct to what you find valuable about Nietzsche's writings? My impression is that, while I might agree with him about some things, he doesn't contribute much that is both novel and helpful. And quotes like the following makes him seem kind of ...psychopathic?: 

> I abhor the man‚Äôs vulgarity when he says ‚ÄúWhat is right for one man is right for another‚Äù; ‚ÄúDo not to others that which you would not that they should do unto you.‚Äù. . . . The hypothesis here is ignoble to the last degree: it is taken for granted that there is some sort of equivalence in value between my actions and thine.

> I do not point to the evil and pain of existence with the finger of reproach, but rather entertain the hope that life may one day become more evil and more full of suffering than it has ever been.

> Man shall be trained for war and woman for the recreation of the warrior. All else is folly

But I haven't read any of his books, only heard summaries and quotes, so perhaps I'm missing something or misunderstanding him somewhat.

Bellow are some examples of texts that I personally would recommend üôÇ

Just before comprehension, you say that cos theta and normal force cancel each other out so to find the net force we just have to take the sum of the frictional force and sin theta. But, then in the comprehension section you solve suing cos theta instead of sin theta. Should cos not have cancelled out with the normal friction and as such not even be a part of the solution?

For example you define points as a set of (x1,x2) in feature space then you throw the label y in there but for defining again points (x,y) then you take the  geometric distance of the line not normalised but with y as a label (i assume y=1 or y=-1 to give the distance from line always a plus sign based on which side we are taking it from aka in which class belongs the point) then you write line equations with x,y again using y as a feature??!  and then take a set of points xi,yi ....and who knows if by xi you mean the whole xi1,xi2 on feature space or whatever is going on in your mind...  
Not to mention that in general you spend MINUTES repeating simple concepts and then skipping ahead doing huge logic leaps on the more complicated stuff..I mean arent you people getting paid to teach these things on real human beings?

1090,"Read This guyz...for some additional info
#Entropy

Entropy, also called as Shannon Entropy is denoted by H(S) for a finite set S, is the measure of the amount of uncertainty or randomness in data.


Intuitively, it tells us about the predictability of a certain event. Example, consider a coin toss whose probability of heads is 0.5 and probability of tails is 0.5. Here the entropy is the highest possible, since there‚Äôs no way of determining what the outcome might be. Alternatively, consider a coin which has heads on both the sides, the entropy of such an event can be predicted perfectly since we know beforehand that it‚Äôll always be heads. In other words, this event has no randomness hence it‚Äôs entropy is zero.

In particular, lower values imply less uncertainty while higher values imply high uncertainty.

#Information Gain

Information gain is also called as Kullback-Leibler divergence denoted by IG(S,A) for a set S is the effective change in entropy after deciding on a particular attribute A. It measures the relative change in entropy with respect to the independent variables.


where IG(S, A) is the information gain by applying feature A. H(S) is the Entropy of the entire set, while the second term calculates the Entropy after applying the feature A, where P(x) is the probability of event x.",0,2

Good idea right cool stuff..      - its makes hard for FBI or a NGO, to report as anything other than a good thing..    am i right ? yes.  TGB the way i mean it

If your new to this, or the type that creates I.G. reports type stuff..     Or do analysis..  

Restart this video from the beginning ...     Whatch it as if it was fox news..    Its got all the timing, the speech  stutters, the ""i dont knows"", the ""uhs-uhs"" stutters the ""ums""   (kind of like the ""ought"" word stuff) the different speeds of speaking.. intentisty..  its timed or tuned...   Its got the different screen lay outs,  from right to left, a split screen of informations.. instead of having 3 speakers or guest (people) in the boxes. anchormen. its has charts, and visual aids...    There one destinct tiime where they indicate the appearance of the thermostat the electronic thermstat ( a.c, tempature), in the screen...  (encompass)

So what this video is...   Compared to fox news.. networking: 
  So instead of introducing you 3 speakers or ""Outnumbered""... its intergrates information of the machine learning type...  instead of being a reader or listener, to people ""automated or talking ""  it has data, thought, algrothymic type stuff as its ""guest speakers""..      Encompasses...

if you want to go on a wild ride.(learn some super skills, get some abilities) mentally as far machine learning goes.     Learn machine learning... then hang out next to a ""spectrometer"" for awhile...   or maybe a couple of radiation devices.

1479,"Remember all A/C are designed to have a nose heavy cg in flight...why...because if the A/C is stalled for any reason, the nose will drop and if you have enough altitude then you can recover from a stall and fly away. If the nose did not automatically drop, you probably would not be able to recover!
If your A/C weights for example 2,683 lbs on the ground, then in flight the wings would have to produce enough lift to support 2,683 lbs plus the balance force to keep the nose up force in flight...lets say that is 127 lbs...so in flight the wings would have to produce 2,683+127=2,810 lbs of lift to maintain level flight. Your A/C will always need to produce more lift than the A/C weighs to fly...that is the cost of the safety feature which would allow the A/C to recover from a stall.
To minimize this effect...try to load you A/C to the Aft limits of your Wt & Balance envelope?",0,

In Calculus 2 for example, it is crucial to know the methodology, layout, proof and notations before you jump into the problem so you understand the actual foundation of what you're doing.

Not everyone can successfully get a job simply by having the appearance of an over-confident Aryan poster child and just winging it without a formal education. If you were not born with the Hollywood looks of a pretty White boy or have the face of an Asian, then I recommend that you get your degree because if you're a minority or female, then the reality is that employers and hiring managers will most likely scrutinize your credentials more for your lack of education than they would if you looked like the lead star in a smug White Supremacist propaganda commercial.",0,

2055,"I am learning ML in Stanford's course. I need to say that background of programming and Maths like Matrix, Statistics, Probability, Linear Algebra, and Differential Calculus is crucial cuz in the nutshell it's all maths.

If you treat the algorithms as black boxes, you won't understand why your model performs terribly using some algorithms compared to the others, how to tune parameters properly, how to debug you ML model, why and when you need to normalize your data points before feeding them to the algorithm, why are there some cases gradient descent can't converge, why gradient descent runs very slowly, how to fix overfitting, what is generalization. what the hell are Learning Rate (Alpha), Lambda, Bias, Back Propagation, etc.

Joel's advice is great but he seems not to know the fundamentals of ML. His example on which music notes are most commonly sang by the singer, is NOT machine learning. It's just simple data processing. Real machine learning projects go beyond that.

My point of view is that Joel is very good at communication and building relationship. That's why he is successful. If you are very good neither at communication nor Maths, you are in trouble.",1,

2166,"One minor correction for those watching at 1:19:12 and trying to follow along (like myself): on line 77 after the ""else"", the ""memStart = int(np.random.choice(range(self.memCntr - batch_size - 1)))"" should actually be ""memStart = int(np.random.choice(range(self.memSize - batch_size - 1)))"". 



The self.memSize is needed here instead of self.memCntr because at this point the self.memory list is now full (the ""else"" branch), but the self.memCntr value is continuing to grow and is now larger than the max self.memory size. That leads to line 78 giving miniBatch an empty list, [ ], leading to memory being an empty array, because memStart will be a larger value than the self.memory list length, while then being used as the index for grabbing the miniBatch from that same self.memory list -- no good. Ultimately that leads to an exception: ""too many indices for array"" on line 81 (since we are trying to forward an empty 1D numpy array and call 2D indices that don't exist). With self.memSize for line 77, that no longer happens, and memStart stays within the bounds of the self.memory length/size. With that, everything works, and you can watch the agent play :)",0,

Bosch make a quality router and would be a good choose. If you can afford it Festool is an AMAZING Germany tool manufacturer. They make tools that practically gives you a mobile shop. Im not a big DeWalt fan because its basically Black and Decker dressed in yellow. They'll get you by and as long as your not hogging five 1/4 oak thru it all day will suffice. Before they bought out theyre competition (PC) they would spread rumors that PC wasnt this but DeWalt was all of that. A really good woodworking friend bought the bigger DeWalt and it literally fell apart in yr. He replaced it with a Porter Cable that he still uses today. This was 15 yrs ago.

The economic impact of car crashes in the US alone amount to over $1 trillion in loss of productivity and damage costs per year. Driving accounted for the #1 most deaths in the US and #9 globally. A World Bank study found that cutting the economic impact of car accidents in developing countries could help them significantly grow financially. Self-driving cars could one day provide individual transportation for the elderly and disabled that wouldn't be able to drive themselves. Self-driving cars driving electric would hypothetically reduce our transportation emission rate even further than if we had all-electric cars driven by humans due to the autonomous system being more efficient with mileage and traffic prediction mapping. 

All 95% of car accidents, all 1.3 million fatal car deaths, much of the traffic and aggressive driving we see today, all those elderly and disabled people unable to drive themselves, all $1 trillion lossed economically due to car crashes in the US, vehicle and transportation contributions to global warming, all those developing countries held back economically by the financial burden of car accidents in their respective countries, and so much more could be avoided simply by going autonomous.",0,

2864,"Given a lot of you have asked links for the specific courses I did, below is the order in which I did it:

1. Firstly, I learnt basic of python programming language by doing a couple of introductory courses from this specialization on Coursera - Programming for everybody https://www.coursera.org/learn/python 
2. After this, I learn basis data science skills and how to code them in python. This was done through completing all the courses in this Coursera specialization which also covered basics of machine learning - https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python 
3. Finally, after I had learnt basic machine learning algorithms, how to code them in python and also had participated in a couple of Kaggle competitions, I finally decided to learn Deep Learning neural networks. For that, I did a full Deep Learning specialization on Coursera by Andrew Ng - https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning

In case, you just want a broad business knowledge of AI without going into coding etc, I would suggest the following course for managers - https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone

3090,Universal basic income . Yes,0,
3091,And by universal basic income being ‚Äútested‚Äù Alaska is not representative of the largest economy of the U.S. And saying it ‚Äúincreases physical health‚Äù? By that logic that would mean everyone on walstreet are in the best physical health. Maybe we should use machine learning for more fact checking and for cherry picked statistics,1,
3092,"Literally the dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever heard. Especially the Finland example, anyone who bring up Finland and Universal Basic Income are the same people who know nothing about economics. If everyone were to receive a check regardless of employment status. That would incentive those who are employed to withdraw from employment because the whole idea is to receive enough money to live financially secure. Also the Finland example is the dumbest thing anyone can bring up, the people who bring this up don‚Äôt know the Europe has been free riding on more 40% of the goods produced from the U.S which drives down the expenses they have to make and overall leads to the effect of more money in their pockets",0,

Communism",1,
3095,THIS IS NOT COMMUNISM. Communism is split equally irrespective of individuals work. UBI is give minimal resource unconditionally required to survive but if u want more work and earn.,0,
3096,Slogans and buzzwords.The idea of basic income comes from lack of understanding of economy. It will never work.,0,
3097,"I don't know, having lived in welfare I can say in mass scale this seems dangerous. Shouldn't we find new economic systems first?",0,
3098,"You don't tackle the real, economic problem, which is you can't just solve poverty by 'printing' more money. It will raise inflation etc etc, it's why governments don't do it.",0,
3099,"I'm ok with voluntary redistribution. Government redistribution will less necessary and even dangerous as automation increases.

Governments get their money from taxes, companies get their money from the sale of products and services. If they completely automate, so no one has a job, so no one is making money, there's no one to buy their products and services, so they aren't making any money, so there's no money to tax. Suggesting governments taking enough money to give to people so they can buy products and that will sustain an economy, literally doesn't hold water. It's like scooping water out of a bucket, spilling a bunch, and dumping it back in and expecting it to be more full. Why wouldn't the companies just give their products and services away for free and keep the government out of it? It would be significantly more efficient. None of this is necessary. This scenario is fictitious, it won't happen. Like natural anti-competitive monopolies, it's not that they CAN'T happen, they're just so unlikely and unstable, every mitigation of such events increases the likelihood of it happening and keep them from collapsing.

Inequality is a good thing, the premise its bad is jealousy, not rationale. Wealthy people having money doesn't leave less money in the economy. The only way to get money in a free economy is to provide something of value. You take raw inputs, you transform it into something that's worth more than the raw inputs and the labor, that difference in value in value into the economy.  When a person buys it, it costs them less money than before, so they can buy MORE with less dollars, literally making them richer. All these regulations and taxes that are supposed to help poor people and make companies operate more efficient are hurting everyone. It's authoritarian control. Like OCD politicians that just can't stand to see anyone out of line and unordered.

As companies automate, their products and services they sell get cheaper. People might make less actual dollars, but (assuming a free market, cause when the government fucks it up and demands you do things their way, that is THE OPPOSITE OF FREE.) People might make less, but the purchasing power of those dollars is more. Free markets help poor people more than ANYTHING ELSE. One of the areas of innovation is in VALUE EXCHANGE. Right now, it's not really worth it to pull out a nickel because someone smiles at you, but value exchange is getting cheaper. What's the value of a hug from a machine vs. hug from a person. People culturally don't like putting value on things, pretending there is some form of altruism in their actions, that's absurd and haughty. Of course there's value there. There will always be things of value for humans to exchange. If food, and shelter, and security, and electronics, all get so cheap they're free like email, which they will have too if they expect people with ""no jobs"" to buy them, then there will be other things people will exchange. Hand made things will find a market. Already people consider things ""hand made"" or ""artisan"" of higher value. If you don't have to buy robot factory built furniture, won't you spend extra to buy a hand built piece, even if ""technically"" it's not as good, even if factories are using advanced AI to make ""hand made"" furniture, that is even superior in it's style of hand made imperfection, would the knowledge that its ACTUALLY hand made be more valuable?

Charity is great. It's even better when you can look the person in the eye when you help them. What about a biometricly linked reputation platform, so when you have a stranger over to your home for a meal and a hot shower, and all the eclectic stories they're bound to have accumulated (that's a free market value exchange, thats capitalism) you can do so with a reasonable sense of safety. A reliable reputation rating for people would increase the efficiency of value exchange, especially if it was seemless and unintrustive to use. Then a lot of homeless and impoverished people, suddenly have something of value.
Why don't you have homeless people over for dinner? Isn't it because you're afraid there's some vagrantcy about them? They might hurt you or take your shit? What if a stranger could show up to your house, and you could invite them inside with the same level of comfort you would feel inviting a neighbor over for dinner?

What will things be worth when nearly everything is practically free? What will shelter look like when you don't have to have a house to protect all your shit? How will the sharing economy change society? How many things do you own that you only use a few times a year? I literally only use maybe a dozen non-consumable items on a daily basis. Bed, clothes, a comfortable chair, a table, a computing device, a large screen entertainment device, a toilet, a car, a house... Food utensils... I think that's about it... Stove... Of course some people will have antiques, things of some sentimental value, or prefer items that are rare, but these items are borderline commodities, there's very little reason a person would want to own them, aside for the sake of owning them. Perhaps its my lack of materialism and not being able to empathize, I think people like to own things, mostly for the sense of security, probably from not feeling secure in their childhood. I'm not talking a utopian communist culture. I'm talking culture valuing the majority of things like you'd value an old t-shirt, or a disposable gladware container. People will still buy it new, but very few people are concerned of the loss of value If they have to give away an old shirt or dinner in an old cottage cheese container.

I'm falling down the rant/example after example/rabbit hole. Basic minimum income isn't necessary. People being charitable always is, for themselves as much as the people they're helping. The ""need"" for a basic minimum income is as much a result of a lost culture of community as it is a cultural sheer lack of gratitude. In the west, we have a basic minimum value provided by the state, and we're bitching and complaining about poverty. We ARE the 1%. We're selfish, gluttonous, and ungrateful. That's a cultural problem. Adding more value on top of that, unless its voluntary, will hurt the economy, and won't help anyone. The reason it appears to help, is because they can see they have more than their neighbors. If your neighbors were as impovershed as much as the majority of the worlds population, it would have the same effect. The lack of happiness and FEELING of wealth is ENTIRELY cultural. No amount of money can fix that.

Ok, rant over, I swear.",0,
3100,I don't want an universal basic income. I think it's another way of control for the government to control the public. What about the people that create the AI to control it? They get basic income too? The system we have now is a good system besides the fiat money. We need to stop using it and go to cryptocurrencies because the centralized money system is corrupt. We all know that. Why you think bitcoin has been dropping? Ask the bankers and think about what JP Morgan did before the  great depression.,1,

Also, I have a couple questions about the disadvantages of a decision tree. You say that the decision tree is high variance and low bias (at 9:02 minutes into the presentation). 



#1. I am not sure why low bias is a disadvantage. Why is that? 



#2. I assume that the closer the decision tree gets to zero entropy (i.e. each leaf contains only one class of data), the higher the variance and the lower the bias. Is that correct? 



#3. I guess that the art of building a decision tree is finding the best sequence of splitting criteria to employ, and knowing when to stop splitting. I guess you can always continue to split until you reach zero entropy, but toward the end of that process you are just learning noise (overfitting). I assume that choosing the ""best"" sequence of splitting criteria essentially determines how soon you start learning noise. 



Please comment on these three questions if you would.

Thank you so much for this. 

Your explanation on the topic was so smooth that I chose to remember it like a television story and just forgot about the constraints in the optimal merge problem. In previous greedy problems (Knapsack and job sequencing), there were constraints and a target; here the target is  minimal merge time; but what is the constraint here? Can I say that ""the 2 way merge"" (i.e. cannot take more than 2 lists at a time) is the constraint? Request your thoughts on this.

Ôøº

Sir James Fergusson,¬†Governor of Bombay

After the¬†Revolt of 1857, Indian luminaries saw a pressing need to modernise the education system to fight against British imperialism by democratic means.[citation needed]¬†Indian Nationalists¬†such as¬†Bal Gangadhar Tilak,¬†Vishnushastri Chiplunkar, and social reformer¬†Gopal Ganesh Agarkar¬†and Mahadev Namjoshi put their efforts into the formation of a school for their countrymen. The result was The New English School.

Boosted by its success, the¬†Deccan Education Society¬†was formed in 1884; a year later Fergusson College was founded. An area of 37 acres (150,000¬†m2) of land was donated for one rupee on a 99-year lease by Shirole, the erstwhile Patil of the village of Bhamburde (now called¬†Shivaji Nagar) on the west bank of the Mutha river.

The college was inaugurated by William Wordsworth, the grandson of¬†the famous poet¬†and principal of¬†Elphinstone College¬†in¬†Bombay. Other leaders such as¬†R G Bhandarkar¬†and¬†M G Ranadeplayed a part in the construction.[18]¬†The college was named after the then¬†Governor of Bombay,¬†Sir James Fergusson. The British colonial Government in Bombay allowed the college to remain autonomous, giving it a free hand in education.

In 1935, the college completed 50 years of existence. Sir¬†CV Raman, India's only Science¬†Nobel laureate¬†at that time, was the president of the Golden Jubilee celebrations. He said in his speech,

‚Äú‚Ä¶ Standing here today, I feel that history has been written in Poona- history of self-help, history of self-reliance, history of great and constructive national effort- that history has been written in Poona, has been written on this very spot ‚Ä¶‚Äù

Mahatma Gandhi, in a message to then Principal Dr. Mahajani wrote,

‚ÄúWho will fail to be enthused over the noble record of the service rendered by the D. E. Society and the Fergusson College to the cause of education?[19]‚Äù

Ôøº

Lokmanya Tilakwas one of the founders of the college

Post-independenceEdit

Post-1947, Fergusson College has produced leaders in the fields of politics, academia, literature and art.¬†Dr. Rajendra Prasad, India's first president, was the chief guest of the platinum jubilee function. He said on the occasion,

‚ÄúThe Fergusson College was established at a time when the attitude of the Indian masses towards higher education of the western type was yet in a formative stage and when facilities for such education for the generality of Indian students were inadequate‚Ä¶ It was an enterprise, which benefited the Nation without offending or alienating the then rulers of India. Fergusson College is the foremost fruit of that effort.[20]‚Äù

In 1985, the college completed its centenary.¬†Rajiv Gandhi, the then prime minister was the president of the ceremony.¬†PV Narasimharao, India's 12th prime minister and former student, said,

‚ÄúThis college, born like a twin of the Indian National Congress, has always kept abreast of the country's history. It has produced political leaders of all hues of the political spectrum including ultras and infras, if I may say so, administrators, eminent scholars, researchers, writers, sportsmen and many other categories of celebrities, which any country can be proud of.[21]",1,

Panda may be good but it is *not* a time machine!  If you are trying to predict tomorrow's close then fair enough but do we *have* to create a column with data from the previous or next row on the ""present"" row? 

The purpose, surely, is to use what can be learned from the matrix of historical data to predict something like ""tomorrows close"" or,  better in my view, ""the +/- $$$_change tomorrow (and tomorrow, and tomorrow...)"".  Being able to predict the size of the change is better than a buy-sell decision at this point because the difference between predicted.close and actual.close is useful in the investment risk assessment, and rather than train on one row, training on multiple rows allows factors like ""the volume (sic) of sales last Friday"" to influence the value (sic) of sales next Friday"".

Anyway at that point the business logic and the way to code it ...goes pretty much to pot.

Think again. The internet should be a wonderful thing, but it is filled with trolls and criminals. Same for driverless cars.

This is why we humans can't have nice things - there'll always be arseholes who fuck it up for everyone else. In the extremely unlikely event that we see true, go-anywhere, all-terrain, all-weather level 5 autonomous vehicles, they will quickly become just the playthings of the very rich.",1,

4725,"As a huge anime/manga fan, I have another analogy to explain the difference. The internet as a whole can be like a big manga publisher in Japan. Since it's from Japan, all the text is in Japanese. The modem can be represented by a localization team translating the manga to English. Once it's translated, the manga is sent to the printing team, represented by the modem, with the readers represented by the computers actually USING the signal. As for sending information back onto the internet, That can be compared to the manga readers noticing a discrepancy in the plot or grammar, and sending a feedback letter. It would first need to be sent to the local publisher, who would pass on the feedback to the translators, who would translate the letter back to Japanese, to be sent to the original writers.

It is just my humble opinion, maybe an easier way to think recursion is by finding the base case first, the part that can no longer be divided into smaller part. And then we can step into the recursive part. For example  the smallest possible values are fib1 and fib 2, so these are the base case, the rest from fib 3 onwards are the recursive case. It also true for the factorial, first find the smallest part, in this case 0 factorial is the smallest value, hence this will be the base case, the rest are recursive case...",1,

Question - Suppose we have a dataset of different cats and dogs and it is 1000 images. Now to hand label these 1000 images would be tedious. That is why we label let's say only 300 ""different dogs and cats"" so that our training data has variety. Now, we train the model and pass the other 700 images for pseudo-labelling. I understand that based on what the model learnt from the 300 images in the training dataset, it predicts the labels for the 700 images. But then we again have to hand label these images with those predictions right? then what is the point? I don't think I follow... ü§î

Which is untrue.
You mention you have to cut and paste the same code?

True...but this is true in a OO environment too.

5979,"11. Allah commands you as regards your children's (inheritance); to the male, a portion equal to that of two females; if (there are) only daughters, two or more, their share is two thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is half. For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left children; if no children, and the parents are the (only) heirs, the mother has a third; if the deceased left brothers or (sisters), the mother has a sixth. (The distribution in all cases is) after the payment of legacies he may have bequeathed or debts. You know not which of them, whether your parents or your children, are nearest to you in benefit, (these fixed shares) are ordained by Allah. And Allah is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise.

12. In that which your wives leave, your share is a half if they have no child; but if they leave a child, you get a fourth of that which they leave after payment of legacies that they may have bequeathed or debts. In that which you leave, their (your wives) share is a fourth if you leave no child; but if you leave a child, they get an eighth of that which you leave after payment of legacies that you may have bequeathed or debts. If the man or woman whose inheritance is in question has left neither ascendants nor descendants, but has left a brother or a sister, each one of the two gets a sixth; but if more than two, they share in a third; after payment of lagacies he (or she) may have bequeathed or debts, so that no loss is caused (to anyone). This is a Commandment from Allah; and Allah is Ever All-Knowing, Most-Forbearing. (Q.S.4 : 11-12)",0,

However, a pointer also gives us indirect access to the object to which that pointer points. We can change the value of that object by assigning through the pointer"" After I read this, I realized C/C++ has so many things need to pay attention to.",1,

The static friction doesn't change the initial force when you go to calculate the Fnet concerning the kinetic friction (i.e. you subtract 26.95 from 100, not 70.6. I suppose one has to know if the force is constant, which most of the time it is for beginning physics problems.",1,

6416,"Join whatever classes or coaching or online lectures you want , just remember one thing , in the long term these things won't be the majority factor for your success , just work on yourself , it's simple , 1. start with whatever you have and whatever you can get online or offline , 2 . You will fail to do upto your expectations , it'll get hard but don't give up stick to it , keep struggling and going through , love the dirt and the grind and the hustle. And one day you will succeed . Just don't worry about any coaching or other stuff , it's all secondary , what is important is you keep doing work irrespective of what coaching or classes you end up in . Just keep up the work and you will succeed . 3. It's is not as easy as it looks . Sometimes the simple things become complicated due to pressure from surrounding and from your self. Give yourself time to grow and just become better by just 1% everyday and you will do very good in the tests , you will get the results. 
The major challenge is getting yourself on the track always without slipping or cheating and if somehow you get off track getting back on it using wisdom and experience without regretting and wasting time . 
Boom . The best advice I can give . Remember it.
Edit : if you feel something is right don't listen to the people , just do it . Do it as fast as you can before someone's opinion of you becomes your own . Just do what feels right in the fastest manner possible . This will give you satisfaction hence clarity hence self confidence hence self esteem hence happiness . Just do it.",1,

6472,"There is  a confusion point on API, Webhook and Zapier. You stated that Wufoo was the webhook and Trello the API then introduce Zapier as middleman. That looks to be a webhook pushing data to Trello. So what it looks like to me is that Wufoo gets data from a user,  Zapier is the webhook that pushes data to Trello. Why can't Wufoo just push the data directly to Trello? You have not clarified what the relationship between the three services and why one needs to use all three as apposed to just two. or it looks like that Wufoo and Zapier are both webhooks and Trello the API. or are there two API's and one webhook? and if so what is the relationship between the two API's?",0,
6473,One of the better lessons on API however your accent is so heavy I could hardly understand many of the words you were using. I would suggest you talk a little slower and focus on pronouncing your words a little better. Many times you start to say a word then say it fast and drop in volume as you say it so that by the time you are done saying the word I can't hear what you are saying. I particularly like that you defined what an API is and how it works at the beginning. Almost all other people who try and teach API never define what it is or how it works. Thank you.,1,
6474,Amazing. thanks!,0,
6475,"Can someone explain why Zapier should be needed?

For example why can‚Äôt Trello just create an endpoint url to receive webhooks and you paste that endpoint into the webhook box at wufoo? 

Ie. Why can‚Äôt wufoo send it‚Äôs webhook directly to trello? Why does it need to go via Zapier? 

Does Zapier ‚Äòtranslate‚Äô the trello webhook into a call that trello will understand?",0,

Example like in your operator overloading part, your project creation part, inheritance part etc.. are irritating at certain point of time. Don't feel bad, I'm not criticizing in a bad, I'm criticizing in a good way..!!! I would suggest you prepare what you want to say seperately and record it seperately..!!! And record the programming  stuff seperately..!!! Later you can mix both the stuff using any  simple audio video mixing tools or even simple android apps like kinemaster etc.. You are good at explaining and providing good examples also, but all your efforts will go in vain if you  kind of make this kind of video. Also the video size can be reduced considerably..!!!",0,

6755,"I really enjoyed the video, however I have some feedback regarding what was said. Around the 5-6 min mark you are talking about creating a variable ""soup"" to store the object information in. ""Soup"" is an object being instantiated from the BeautifulSoup class itself and is not a variable. Also you mention that  ""find_all"" is a method to the BeautifulSoup object above which is a class not an object. You do correctly reference ""soup"" as an object after the fact but I only wanted to point this out as it may be confusing for some viewers. I find its important to use the terminology correctly to help those learning to understand what is going on, and when we mix things up when making these videos, it can often lead to confusion. I wont pick apart the whole video, but just wanted to point out a couple of the early things I noticed. To me its like calling a method a function even though they are similar they are not the same. Please don't get upset over me pointing this out. I just want to help make the terminology consistent with what is going on so you can make more accurate videos for those learning off of these in the future. Thanks again for the tutorial!",0,

Thanks.


In your production environment, you have deployed an application that is accessing a registered Java EE shared library as well as an application deployment plan. In addition, both the library and the application use annotations for some of their configuration properties. You are attempting to understand the current state of the properties that have been used in this deployment.
From greatest to least, what is the correct order of precedence that is used by Weblogic Server when applying configuration properties during deployment?

a. Deployment Plan, Library descriptors, Library annotations, Application descriptors, Application annotations.
b. Deployment Plan, Application descriptors, Library descriptors, Application annotations, Library annotations.
c. Deployment Plan, Library descriptors, Application descriptors, Library annotations, Application annotations.
d. Deployment Plan, Application annotations, Library annotations, Application descriptors, Library descriptors.
e. Deployment Plan, Application descriptors, Application annotations, Library descriptors, Library annotations.",0,

Steps for anyone interested:
1. Make your repository
2. Clone it into a folder like in this tutorial
3. Enter that folder in your command line and use theme get to download the theme you want into your git folder
4. git add -A <------to add all files onto your gitHub repository
5. git commit -m ""Adding files to repository initially""
6. git push
7. theme watch <-----to watch the files for changes
8. Whenever you make a substantial change to a snippet(or another file)----> git add snippets/yoursnippet.liquid
9. git commit -m ""changed this snippet""
10. git push

Probably the best video for 2 reasons.
1> You addressed the fact about viewers who ask silly/obvious questions just because they dont work hard enough themselves to find out & also as you mentioned people.feeling nice about you replying to them and they expecting to be spoonfed all of the skills through you.

2> What you mentioned about experience of solving problems,hitting a wall,reading theory and repeating the process indefinetely is so true.
Only people who have done it will understand the authenticity of what you said.The process is pure passion and relentless stubbornness to succeed no matter what.It is a beautiful process.

And yeah this is an.amazingly bold and much needed video.

6905,"I like videos of Gaurav Sen but unfortunately I disagree with the initial fact - DO NOT ASK SILLY questions (which was not presented as a myth but a fact).
 Before presenting my conjecture, I wanted to specify that I might not be an expert about the culture of Software companies in India. I only worked in India only for 3 years till 2014 before I shifted to US to work in Silicon Valley California.
So I would encourage to ask as many questions as you can even though they might be silly. The reason being the investment of time in researching about the answer. Nowadays, asking questions is really encouraged in software industry because if the requirements are not crystal clear, then you might land into developing completely different product or a different module. 
I worked with few large companies in US and encourage new hires / interns to ask as many questions before starting to code. This is SHEER UTMOST fact any recruiter ( Google, MS, Uber, Amazon, Facebook) will always tell you before interviewing with their companies.",0,

You're 100% right when you say that people need the kind of critique that helps them see what they're doing right or wrong (if they want to grow). We don't want false praise or watered down advice.

7229,"IPFS is very exciting, but how would one manage to create webapps with it? How can you create a hash of a REST API for instance? Ergo, decentralization cannot replace completely HTTP webservers like that. At best, we could host static HTML pages, markdown or entirely client-based applications, but not an application that requires something like a centralized database for example.

Also, I don't get why we must absolutely incentivize file hosting by peers. The decentralized web is a possibility for 2 clients to communicate between themselves, but that is not an obligation. If you want to share some photo on the network, you should always have the possibility to host it on p2p on your computer. The drawback is that the connection may be crappy or you would have to always keep your computer on because no one would want to seed it, so you might want to make someone host it for you, whether it be some dude at FileCoin or some company that is specialized in p2p hosting. As we see, the web wouldn't change so much as there would still be large companies of hosting like GoDaddy to centralize data, but you as a peer would always be able to choose to store and share it from your computer.

In conclusion, what a decentralized web truly means is just that HTTP webservers would not be necessary to share static files like photos, videos, audio, text or executable files, but you could still choose to make companies host it because it is more convenient. But as I said, for content that is generated dynamically like REST APIs or websites generated with templating, HTTP is still necessary.",0,

7241,Is it good for secret files.....,0,
7242,The notion of retrieving content from peers closest to you physically isn't how it works. Your client connects to peers based on a distance between each client's address (cryptographically random) and each node stores content when the content ID matches closest to their client id. This is why the IPFS gateway is extremely slow when accessing files which you do not own since the nodes it has to access could be halfway around the world.,1,

7592,"Hi Dave, very instructive video, congratulations. Please let me ask you a question: 
I know caret does not impute with factors. But how do you do in practice when you need to impute data to categorical/factor variables? (discarding the mode)
In the example of your video, in the dataset ""imputed.data"" you have two columns/dummies for Sex. If you -hypothetically-impute missing values for them, how do to take them back to the original dataset, in which there is only one column for Sex?",0,
7593,"If you get ""subscript out of bounds"" in the train() function, change the parallelization engine over to the future engine as it is better at exporting environments:
library(parallel)
library(future)
library(doFuture)
plan(""multisession"") #if you're seeing this error, you're likely on a Windows machine anyway
registerDoFuture()

And also comment out the makeCluster, registerDoSNOW, and stopCluster lines.",0,
7594,Brilliant and great advert for your bootcamps!,1,
7595,"Thanks for the tutorial. Talking about model based imputation, let us say we have 3 numeric variables to impute. 

How the imputation will work if we want to impute the first variable? Does caret will consider complete case approach for the rest of data? If so, how then it will impute the original first variable if it happens that for a record one of second or third variable has missing value?

What is the procedure here?
Thanks.",0,
7596,This was really great Dave.  I've done a bunch of your tutorials online including the intro to data science videos you did using the Titanic Kaggle competition about 4 years ago.  What I enjoyed the most about this video was seeing how much more confident and impassioned you have become as a data scientist since those prior videos.  You can tell that it really excites you and that is infectious in a teaching environment.  I too have become somewhat hooked on data science and I was one of those students that avoided statistics at all costs at every level of education. I'm looking into coming to one of the data science bootcamps at the data science dojo and really looking forward to learning from people that are equally passionate about data science and hopefully making up some lost ground.  Keep up the great work.,1,

7600,"Very good video and excellent explanation. I have a question about a job that I am doing ... I want to do an analysis using random forests, I read in some materials that there is no need to divide the data into training and testing. If not, cross validation and bagging and boostrap make the data itself more general. I am trying to avoid dividing into data of training and testing, because I have few instances for some factors and sometimes they do not fall within my training data ... Please I could use some advice .. Thank you.",1,2

7602,"Great video @Dave. Super helpful; I love the step-by-step Q&A. 
Just curious: is it 'good' practice to include the test set when imputing data? shouldn't it be done on the train set only?",1,
7603,Great video.. caret is amazing.. one question though... If we are doing stratified sampling then we don't have to balance the data? Because if we don't balance the data then the outcome will be biased and if we balance the data then it will be manipulation,1,
7604,Thanks for the video! Quick question - why do you have to split the data into a training/test set of 70/30 when you are going to do 10-fold cross-validation (90/10 split?) anyway later on? Are these two different things?,1,

The real inventors were Curtis who developed the rod-tube system of two types of glass with a different index of refraction, and Peter Schmidt who developed a modern manufacturing process of vaporized glass attaching to the tube through adhesion rather than insertion thus forming a rod.

7834,"@Simon Carroll

Use the logic used by many telephony companies. When the call is waiting then play a message for the caller before forwarding the call to executive check if that message is playing then forward the call else shift to next call. Right now that's what i can suggest you.",0,
7835,"Thanks alot! yep I need to shift the data. I'm building a call center simulation. I.e add call, process call but I also need the ability to remove a particular call (if they disconnect while waiting in queue) ",1,2
7836,"@Simon Carroll

So, you want the element to be there, but blank? 
| 123 | 456 | 784 | 935 | 068 |

And you want to change it to: 
| 123 | 456 |  0  | 935 | 068 |

If so, just set the value of that cell to 0 (or NULL).

If you mean to get rid of that element, you'd need to shift all the ones to the right of that element one to the left:
for (int i = index; i < /* length */; i++)
array[index] = array[index+1];
array[length-1] = 0;",1,

8073,"Hi, this video is very interesting, I read your comments about trend lines and you explained that ‚Äúthe common way to evaluate the goodness is R^2‚Äù; for example I have the values of x and y and I applied all of these. If I choose quadratic the R^2 is 0.997 but if I choose cubic expression R^2 is 1. It‚Äôs possible to compare the coefficients of the two equations and to determine what is the negligible value: quadratic: y = 7E-10x^2 - 2E-05x + 1.1516, cubic: y = -3E-14x^3 + 1E-09x^2 - 2E-05x + 1.1529 for the target.

8079,"Clear presentation, I think it's quite telling that the loss on the validation set does not really decrease. This is typically a sign that the network is 'just' overfitting on the training data and not learning anything generalizable. Furthermore, augmenting the images should typically be done in a way that relates to the domain of the test dataset. Typically, car pictures are not upside down, augmenting in this way could actually lead to worse performance when the segmentation model is used on new data of real images (such as cars).


Finally, in order to really understand how well the model performs you could have the model generate segmentation maps on the test images and compare the generated segmentation maps to the ground truth segmentation map. Looking at this visually gives a much better understanding of model performance/generlization than just inspecting the numerical loss value (or dice coefficient).


It is really nice that you share your results! This is particularly useful for anyone trying to implement segmentation models themselves, as it covers a lot of details that you encounter when doing so (such as the data prep or augmentation choices).

8125,"I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. 

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called ""Linux"", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called ""Linux"" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.",0,

8192,"Here is a quick *summary* of linear regression:
- Linear regression is finding out the best *linear* relationship that describes some data you have.
- It is important to note, that you *assume* there *is* a linear relationship between your dependent and independent variables
- Once you make that assumption, you next need to figure out the *specific* linear relationship 
- We know that the general form of a linear relationship looks like this: Ax + By = C
- We want to find a *specific* linear relationship, i.e. a specific set of A, B and C, such that, this linear relationship fits our data best.

- Let's expand on what we mean by ""fits our data best""
- We know that once we get a linear relationship, that relationship allows us to predict our independent variable (y) given our dependent variable (x)
- We have some sample data (called the test data) where we allredy know the ys for given xs.
- What if for each of our sample data, we compare the known y and the y that we get if you use our specific linear relationship?
- So now, our goal has become: To find the specific linear relationship that will result in ys as close to your actual ys in your sample data as possible.
- If you have done that, then you say that you have found a ""best"" fit line.

- In the above example, we consider a situation where we only have *one* independent variable, but you could have many and the same concept will still apply.
-If you have many independent variables, the general form of a linear relationship will look like: *Ax + By + Cz + ... = F* where A, B, C and F are parameters, you want to find values of A, B, C and F that fit your sample data best. See nothing changes if you add more independent variables!

The *key thing* to know about *linear* regression:
You *assume* there is a linear relationship between your data and you then find a specific linear relationship that best fits your data.

But I'd like to make some constructive criticism: I would have much rather seen how to do a slug based lookup, or a bit about front-end users, or some real world validation, etc... than watching you redo the views 3 times using different methods. This is especially no good for beginners. Too many design choices can be absolutely paralyzing for a beginner. They will spend too much time deciding which to use when they could be writing some app logic and getting real experience. And if you focus on one method they will become more competent and confident in it. It'll also be more memorable. Perhaps teaching the first two methods could be justified, but there really was no need to rewrite the whole thing with raw class based views. Do beginners really need that info? At most it deserved was a mention that you could also do it that way.",1,

8328,"Good message but it also has plenty of Propaganda spun up into it.  You have to listen to both side of the story to get too the roots of any problem even if it does center around a demographic of people or a different race.  Just because racism is a bad thing and should not be tolerated does not mean one should ignore the problems a race of people or a religion is having within it's group.  It's the oldest scapegoat trick in the book, yell racism and hide behind the shade of the people that run to defend that group or creed or religion.  Soon the idea or what ever reason the certain group was under heat about just vanishes into thin air.
   I do firmly believe that we need to be united as a people and forget about the little things, we need to stop fearing every little thing that is natural in life and that includes death and the fear of it. Just because some nut or some agenda pusher kills a few people you can't allow anger and pain to dictate your good senses and your ability to critically think. You would not let emotion dictate the way you handle problems at work or in a relationship or ate least you should not do this this and neither should you allow your emotions to guide your decisions when it comes to political and constitutional values.  After all once emotion gets involved it's usually only anger that is more useful then the sword and it's one of the few emotions we have that has a purpose that is very important when it comes to preserving our life, liberty, and the future of our children.  If it has gone to the point that anger is making the decisions then politics has already failed and it has degraded to the point of decision making at arms.....or as we call it in the military....decisions made at the wrong end of a gun...every one makes the right decision then lol...the one to live usually.",0,

as you said it's a big mess of controlling and washing minds distroying the true felling and our way to think just let us living in endless war.
We must belive in love , near  our lovely family  and friends.

I‚Äôve always been a great father but after the dozenth time Catching her cheating again and at a hotel this time then her gaslighting the shit out of me for 4 days while telling me after 17 years and 2 kids that ‚Äúshe feels nothing for me‚Äù all I did was grabbed her by the arm to get the truth for once from her phone. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have but I was so broken by then still I never hit or pushed a woman period yet she had me arrested for DV spent 2 days in jail then served a restraining order when I got out keeping me from any and all contact with my 3 & 6 year old girls for 3 months straight  then court gave her 100% custody with no due process whatsoever I was given supervised visitation that they say is 1hr a week well that‚Äôs bullshit!  Every time I‚Äôve tried to make an appointment the earliest available is 3-4 weeks away. And these visits are only 45 minutes plus I‚Äôm paying $60 per visit. Ugh its soul crushing honestly as a father who loves those girls more then anything in this world.  Normally my 6 yr old and I just hug and cry together the last 5 minutes of our way too short visits... I just found this website below today actually for a class action federal case fighting against corrupt family court and fighting for our constitutional rights as parents to keep our rights to be a parent and I‚Äôm praying will return my girls to me and get them away from their miserable emotionally abusive mother before she completely poisons their innocence. If there‚Äôs other parents out there going through this please join the fight it‚Äôs completely free, I promise I was skeptical too. All I ask is use my code when you sign up because supposedly I will get more help from them the more people I can find who have been wronged and deserve justice so please I‚Äôm dying knowing my girls are stuck with that monster 24/7 and court gave her more then I can afford in child support to... I‚Äôm drowning in debt and getting evicted now thanks to her my code is 95350WS209 let‚Äôs help each other take these extortionists down for good! 

JOIN FREE: Federal Class Action for U.S. Child Custody Victims -

Friends, I just joined CAPRA as one of the lead plaintiffs in an upcoming landmark federal class action lawsuit against all 50 States and the Federal Government, because I qualify as: (1) a biological parent whose child custody was unconstitutionally removed without due process; and, (2) I have been directly impacted by that during the last four years, i.e., within the statute of limitations.  This class action is on behalf of *both* types of ""family court"" -- for wrongful victims of divorce-and-similar-with-kids *and* for wrongful victims of child protection services -- and includes suing on behalf of ANY parent affected by either ""family court"" type.

It's totally free to join, and the federal court relief being demanded includes the full restoral of my child custody rights under law, plus a nice share of the large amount in civil damages expected.  Check it out!

It just requires entering someone's referral Code to join, so PLEASE use mine -  95350WS209  - in the CAPRA registration form, located on the bottom of the homepage at http://parentalrightsclassaction.com

Plus, check out their power-packed Legal Tips page for all parents fighting family court, too -- Wow!!

Thanks!!

 

Free tips on how to *rapidly* increase your CAPRA leadership level *and* your share of the civil damages award are available at http://parentalrightsclassaction.com/evenfaster.html

8511,"Hi James, I've appreciated your videos on narcissists. My niece is a textbook case narcissist. A year and a half ago, she visited my place with an agenda to live off me. When her plan did not work, she unleashed verbal and emotional abuses to me although she was at my place because I invited her per my sister's request. We have not communicated since, but she has just contacted me again via email and I feel she is trying to manipulate into my life again as she is not economically independent yet. She is 31 years old. How do I make it clear to her I will not live with her just because she is my niece? This is tricky as she is a member of my family. I would greatly appreciate your advice.

Bottom line is that spiritually and on a molecular level, ‚Äúwe are all connected.‚Äù
Narc and non-narc are projecting into this world and the spectrum of stages of reality are negative and positive but still connected. Yet, each reality proposes to be ‚Äúright,‚Äù ‚Äúthe dominating one,‚Äù ‚Äúdividing with the aim to conquer ‚Äú the world. This is not the first of its type, no, it has happened throughout mans‚Äôs history. 
Ecclesiastes 8:8...so wickedness will not allow those who practice it to escape.
9¬†All of this I have seen, ..., during the time that man has dominated man to his harm.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- We are witnessing something great in this world because we are all involved on a daily basis. 
Does a gardener/farmer remove the weeds from the field of wheat? If the weeds and wheat were actual humans, how could anyone differentiate in order to separate wickedness from this world? 
The positive human produces fruit, or thoughts/action that project positively on the world‚Äôs reality. 
The negative human projects division, and destruction results in a reality upon this world. 
Different reality is the dysfunction because WE FEEL it and that‚Äôs what we remember because we are all connected.",1,

8742,Tbh I kind of liked you before this. But I saw many people complaining how your git code is not working.

8743,"The way AlphaZero did it if I understand right is that it critiques the current state, not the future state given an action. So all you have to put in is S to receive the fitness (and policy vector). It's more of a fitness value than reward, due to context.
This is possible since Chess has a finite number of positions pieces can be. The best output from the policy network is simulated and then passed back through the NN. State transition predictions are actually hardcoded (it always returns the ACTUAL state that would occur given an action, not a prediction of the actual state from a simulate_move function).
So if my understanding is right, this is used for instead of hardcoding the state transitions for simulation, it uses a NN to predict the outcome state?",1,

8746,"Hey Siraj, I'm a huge fan and watch the great majority of your videos. Having said that, let me repeat a bit of constructive criticism: you explain the concepts really well, but often only flash by the actual results. 

For instance, in this video there are only 5 seconds (from 8mins1secs to 8mins5secs) of the Doom bot playing. It would be much more satisfying if you showed it playing for let's say 15 or 20 seconds. This would only add 10 to 15 seconds to the length of the whole video, but the audience would get to appreciate the results a lot better. 

best and keep up the great work! :)",1,

8751,"Did anybody actually try to run the source code? I've seen the same code snippet in two different places and none of them worked. Frankly - not only does it not work, it also has a lot of redundancy (many unused variables and errors), typos which make the code work incorrect, but are not spotted because the update methods are actually dead code which is never called. Basically the whole example is doomed because of the fact that it's just a single run through the environment and it usually stops just by hanging down. After fixing this it also does not work because the update function is never called. If you call the update function at the end of the train method it has runtime errors because of typos and wrong model use (trying to assign critic weights to the actor) and to be honest - even the neural nets are wrong - both have ReLUs as output layers, but the inputs can be negative (impossible with ReLU) and the Q-values should be mostly negative (most of the rewards are negative).",0,

8928,"Pune University is the most unprofessional university in the world. It was the worst decision of my life. They cannot declare results in time. The exam papers are check by idiots. They failed me in a subject 3 times and 4th time when I lost hope; I wrote made up answers just to fill up the exam paper they passed me. I studied hard in one subject and attempted 75 % of the exam paper and I got 45/100 marks. As if its their rule that if you attempt 100 % paper then you are eligible to get 60 marks and above.

People if you are in pune university then use simple english in paper because othewise I am pretty sure they don‚Äôt understand. And stick to the language of the local author books (techmax and all other shits). One more thing you need to have very strong memory power because these widely used local author books has tonnes of mistakes which confuse reader instead of helping. At many instances I have found the data printed these books are directly copied from wikipedia. So there is plagiarism also.

One more thing you may also experience the hatred of local people(kattar marathi-some teachers also come under this category) if you are non marathi. Thanks to Shiv sena and MNS.

In short pune university is run by people who are uneducated,rude,backward, sadist and has a big ego. Even president of india does not have that big ego. People don‚Äôt join this university if you are hindi. I cannot say one good thing about this university even if I want to because there is none.

India is a backward country(especially maharashtra) where people call white people racist and discriminate our own people.

Jai hind (no jai maharashtra, no jai gujrat, no jai madhya pradesh so on so forth‚Ä¶..) only Jai hind‚Ä¶ Jai Hind‚Ä¶..",0,

9186,Thanks ! The Best explanation!!! Keep up the good work!,1,
9187,This is bottom-up solution. It would be better if you go through Recursion -> Memoize -> Bottom-up approaches.,0,
9188,"The first row is not exactly total weight rather it is knapsack size, so if knapsack size is zero we cannot contain any item. If it is one I can have first item, if knapsack size is 3 I can have either first or second item and so on. Also I believe we should first consider what is changing if thief puts item in knapsack e.g. weight will change and capacity of bag will reduce, value will increase and capacity will reduce and so on. Considering all these variables we need to try to reduce the recurrence on our own. IMO that would have been better.

Also at 15:19 j should have been replaced with w where i (0,1,...i-1) are the items we can pick and w is the weight knapsack can carry.",0,
9189,worst explanation,0,
9190,best platform for easy understanding....,1,
9191,"@tushar  Why do we need to run two loops with W and number of items? If the total W is 1000000 and number of items is 3. This loop will still run for 1000001*3 times. In the given example in the video there will be 8*4 = 32 number of calculation. Although it can be done using only 6 number of calculation. I have executed my code with various example and it runs correctly on all the cases.
Although it takes same space complexity i.e., W*n but we don't have to fill the entire 2D matrix. Please correct if I am wrong.",0,
9192,"Yes, but do they understand? And do they have morals or a code of ethics of their own? Do AI want? Do AI have their desires? Can
they feel emotion? Can they feel pleasure and pain? Can they think for themselves. Do they understand the difference between their digital world and

9378,"Here is a quick *summary* of this video:

-SVM can be used to do *binary* classification
-SVM finds a *hyper-plane* (line in 2d, plane in 3d, etc) that separates its training data in such a way that the distance between the hyper plane and the closest points from each class is maximized
-once SVM finds this hyper-plane, you can classify new data points by seeing which side of this hyper-plane they land on

-SVM can only be used on data that is *linearly separable* (i.e. a hyper-plane can be drawn between the two groups)
-Fear not though, as a common way to make data linearly separable is to map it to a *higher dimension* (but beware, as this is computationally expensive).
-You can map it however you want, but there are established ways to do it, they are called *Kernels* . By using a combination of these Kernels, and tweaking their parameters, you'll most likely achieve better results than making up your own way :P

-The really cool thing about SVMs are that you can use them when you have *very little data* compared to the number of features each of your data points has. In other words, when the number of data to the number of features per data ratio is low. Normally when this ratio is low, you experience overfitting, but since SVMs only use a few of your data points to create the hyper-plane in the first place, it doesn't really care that you give it such little data. Note however that accuracy of predictions is reduced when you use very little data.
-SVMs simply tell you what class a new data point falls in, *not the probability* that it's in that class. This is of course a disadvantage.

Thanks for such a fun, engaging, simple, yet *informative* explanation of SVMs! Really enjoyed watching this!",1,

9510,"Regarding autoML, after time there would seem to be an ever increasing corpus of models. Humans, being the limited creatures that tend to have the same problems, might not actually need to have a ‚Äòfresh‚Äô model trained every time their brain perceives a problem that needs solving. That solution probably already exists and has been solved.  Rather , it might be faster (and much less energy intensive)to simply archive these models with a set of useful metadata so that a google search can find the model that solves the problem. And metadata selection and assignment to individual models can be automated after they are designed by autoML. The metadata can be considered as the ‚Äòlabel‚Äô for the model. This metadata can also be used to ‚Äòexplain‚Äô to a user ‚Äòwhy‚Äô the machine selected a particular model/algorithm.    in addition, the machine would be able to engage the user in a ‚Äòconversation‚Äô  - as it ‚Äòasks for metadata‚Äô. The user would perceive this discourse as questions about the dataset/problem that he/she has-meanwhile the machine is building an information tree to sift/sort from its vast library of models. This also addresses the human problem where the user often starts by choosing the wrong approach to solving the problem. Or just as often uses the ‚Äòcooked spaghetti‚Äô approach to model selection - throw them all against the wall of the problem and see what sticks.",0,

10202,"As far as I think RL is about searching a vast computational space using ingenious methods. These methods let us decrease our search space and make us use less computational resources than we would require otherwise. 

In the end, we still do not have the perfect solution but what we do have is a better solution than all our previous worked out solutions. With an increase in computational power and ingenuity of our algorithms, we can hope of approaching to that perfect solution. 

But RL is still far from being applied to the real-world scenarios which are infinitely more complex than Atari games or the game of go. If someone can do that then I guess they have a solution to artificial intelligence. But I think there are many obstacles and bottlenecks that one has to overcome to do that.  

The first one being able to provide the ability of vision and language interpretation to an RL agent. This is where deep learning can help. But we still need better feature extracting algorithms than convolution neural nets and LSTMs. 

By looking at these neural nets one can see a direct analogy with the human brain. Convolutional neural net is like the visual cortex and RL is like the Neocortex (the part of the brain that receives info from all the senses processes it and takes decisions based on it, provides us with the ability to behave and act intelligently,  plus it also stores memories).

In this sense, the recent research in AI is going in the very right direction and I am very glad to be a part of it.",1,

10463,Excellent intro. Ditto on usr :) Please give us some more :),1,
10464,"I find basically that only 2 things are not good in the linux file system. The first is that all the drives and partitions are ""physically"" contained in subdirectories in the root. It gives only troubles when you want copy/clone the root partition. If you, or some action, delete the ""media"" or ""mnt"" folder, you wipe out also all files from all the drives in one shot! And when you do a simple search for a file in the root partition, the file manager searches also in all connected drives and partitions. It should not be.
All the non root partitions should be mapped outside of the root, in a similar way as in Windows.
The second thing is the missing of an ""Application"" folder, where the installed programs store all their components, without to spread them through in all the file system. I don' know well the Mas OS, but I think it has a better software management than Linux and Windows.",1,
10465,"It is accepted that Linux is based on Unix. The directory name /usr is based on the word user, not Universal System Resource. In early Unix systems it was where you stored your files (/home didn't exist).; See page 48 of The Unix Programming Environment by Kernighan & Pike",0,

.
you're really brave, choose the cutting edge library like redux-observable, react-router v4 and tackle all the problem in livestream, awesome! :D
.
the last things i would like to share with you about reducers, look like you just break the redux principle which says ""Changes are made with pure functions."" (http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html)
.
I think, all side effect stuff should be completed in the Epic such as make async call, save something to localStorage or push the react-router state, that make the reducers no side effect and test easier.
.
here is useful example for push router state in Epic https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/blob/master/examples/navigation/epics/adminAccess.js",0,

My program gets ""bad access""  errors, at an unpredictable pattern. And everything because objects of <class> Queue cannot keep their freaking member pointers set to NULL. They chaotically assign them to some addresses, crashing my functions with ""bad access"" errors. I am a novice,  I spent 7 hours trying to figure it out without any luck. I think i should better stick to the technique when 2 dummy nodes ""head"" and ""end"" are summoned and pointed at each other at the creation, instead of pointers with NULL values. They just can't keep NULL! Sigh.... So many corrputed pointers.",0,

If we compare this with Java programming

There is a difference between instance/local variables and variable declared in the class. In Java we used to declare the variables first outside of function like var length,width; and then you assign values but JS is different? Please clarify?

11806,"Just so everyone knows, the typical C++ convention is that one should use structs when they want an object with only variables, namespaces when they want an object with only functions, and classes when they want an object with both. Since classes do exist in C++ (in The C Programming Language structs were your only option), we will typically mainly use classes since they are more optimized, which means what was being done in this video with structs, while it can be done (since apparently structs are considered to be mostly the same as classes as far as the compiler is concerned), it is usually frowned upon. I also found one key difference (and I don't know why it exists) between classes and structs. I was testing out making the area function in the Shape struct virtual, since this is another method of overriding functions in classes, and I found that my default constructor that I had (i.e. Shape() = defualt;) no longer initialized all of the variables to zero values. This was odd since the default constructor did initialized all of the values to 0 when the function wasn't virtual. When I replicate this using classes, the same error does not occur. My recommendation is to just stick with classes if you're a new programmer and only worry about structs or namespaces if you have a specific need for them. My understanding is that structs are typically smaller and less bulky than classes which is why they're used if you only need variables. I should probably also mention that namespaces don't just have to be used with functions. You can define classes or other things inside of namespaces just to give them scope, which to my knowledge is fair game in C++ development and can be very helpful. In addition, ideas liike utility classes in C++ (which is your only option in a lot of other languages) gets expanded upon with namespaces as you can create an entire utility class using a namespace instead if you don't need member variables! I guess I'm just trying to clarify that namespaces are not the same thing as structs or classes, but that when you're talking about containing both variables and functions, or containing one or the other, namespaces can be thought of as public classes for functions if it makes it easier",0,

11808,"Hello, thank you for the video. Could i just ask you to explain this piece of code?

Syntax basically means constructor Circle with double w, inherits from class Shape, that passes value w into Circle. "" Thanks again.",0,
11809,"Derek I like your videos you should try to showcase the technical details. In your example of virtual function was demonstrated in a case where it goes through without the virtual keyword. I think this makes a difference when using function pointers, but not in what you did. You perhaps could have showcase the access inheritance as well as in class Circle : protected Shape{}‚Ä¶.",1,
11810,"I have few questions if you don't mind ;)
1. Is there other use for polymorphism besides having a possibility to make a function outside classes to ""manage"" that all?
2 .Why would you use override final, if there is a risk of getting error? code clarity?
3.In function ShowArea, was it necessary to use refference? if yes, why?
4.Is there any difference between doing e.g. int SomeFunc(class/int/somethingelse& name) and int SomeFunc(class... &name)
5. If you have like 5 classes named e.g class1 class2 class3 class4 and class5,  class 2 inherits from class1, class 3 inherits from class 2 and so on, then every class inherit class1, yes?",0,

Most of them are 3-4 years old. I've heard that now Kotlin is used instead of Java? Also Flutter comes in the way? Of course I assume that documentation will be needed, just prefer your videos and don't want to be ""influenced"" by anyone else. In other words, what is the most ""suitable"" solution for this problem? Thank you.",0,

12155,"First you should appreciate me that i am taking my precious time out of my busiest life just to tell you some small secrets of this college and about this life. Because writing such lengthy description requires another level of patience.
I'm also graduate of Arena Animation and at that time it's headquarter was based in New Jersey, USA ( Now i heard it is based in India ). i'm running my Cinematography and Film Production Studio and we do projects both local and internationally. I must tell you that this is one of the finest Animation College in Asia but i have observed that Indian and Pakistani students never ever realized it's worth and always found complaining about it's faculty.
First you must know that graphic design and production softwares are so vast and huge that you cannot learn a single software even in 2 years like Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro CC.. You must have a passion in ART, Creativity and ofcourse Hardworking to survive in this field because no teacher or student can teach you each and everything in such short span of time. 

So Learn, Create and Make brochures, Catalogs, Color Schemes, 1 color 2 color 4 color or 12 color printing jobs, Edit Videos in slow motion, Learn Frame Rates and Get knowledge about New Cameras and Lenses. I can bet that Arena Students are far more skilled then any Top University students. 
and one more thing, getting 1 lac per month job is a Slang and it is just a stupid marketing tactics by colleges so be realistic. you should prepare yourself to walk in extreme Summers and Winters and work in different environments where every person thinks himself as a BOSS of your's and will treat you like a shitty garbage person and you have to develop skills to deal with such crooks in offices as well. After all life is not a bed of roses. And believe me i mastered very few cinematographers and video editors under my leadership and rest of them just ran away because majority of people never wants to put their asses on the chair to sit for a long time to learn the fuck involved in this huge market.

I'm also From Arena Animation Gorakhpur 
1st Thing ye Institute ke sikhane ke uper depend karta hai aao kitna sikh pate ho aur wo aapko kitna Sikha pata hai Mai recommend karunga agar aap arena animation ya maac Me ho to waha par sikhne ke sath Khud se bhi sikho online 
tum jitna extra Sikhoge Industry me jame Rahne ke liye utna hi Help Milega Tumhe Kabhi bhi institute par depend mat rahna Wo sirf tumhe Tools batayega Creativity Tumhe dikhani hai 
en institute me Total Kaam Practical Hota hai No theory etc Matlab tumhe Laptop ya system par batayenge wahi tumhe karna hota hai  institute Join karne se pahle Tum ye jarur confirm kar lena Ki tumhe job kis field me karna hai mtlab movie making me jana hai ya architecture line me aagr movie making ya cartoon making me jna hai to mai recommend karunga ki graphics karne ke baad Direct Maya kar lena   
tumhra total 70 or 80 k me Nipat jayega 
aur kuch mat karna warna paisa waste hoga bro 
job prosseing ye hai 
ki jab tum maya kar lete ho to kai sare studios vacancy nikalte jai like Maya Digital Studio Mumbai jha motu patlu aur bhaut sare cartoon bnaye jate hai waha par job lag jati  hai 
jab company vacancy nikalti hai to Tumko Apna show reel bhejna hota hai Company ke pass show reel matlab khud ka bnaya hua project agar tumhra show reel company ko pasand ata hai to wo tumko ek test file bhejti hai jisko tumko banan hota hai ek limited tym me jab tum bna ke bhejte ho to compny ko agar pasand ata hai to wo tumko Interview ke liye bulati hai starting me tumko tumhre kaam ke uper paisa milega 10 se 15 k ke bich me phir jaise hi tumko 6 months ka Experience hota hai tumhri sallery increase ho jayegi 20 k to 25 k around something usake baad tum aur bade studio me apply kar sakte ho 
sallery depend on your skill 
kuch Points Dhyaan rakhna bhaut jaroori hai 
1 - Agar Iss industry me aaaye ho to raat me Sona mana hai 
2 - Tumme Creativity Honi chaiye 
3-  sketching is a plus point 
4-. Saare institute bure nahi hote 
5 - Institute se jyada Online sikho hamesha apne ko ek kadam aage rakho Tumhe institute se padkar sartificate lena hoga Bade compny  me manga jata hai 
6- Iss course ko Karne ke liye atleast tumhre pass 8 Gb ram aur 4 Gb Nvidia Geforce ka graphics card wala laptop hona chaiye 
7- agar filmmaking me jana hai to only Graphics aur Auto desk Maya karna Baki to apne app online bhi sikh skate ho
agar Tumhe Softwares Aur Filmmaking vFx me Interest Hai to tum jarur aao Aur agar tumhra Interest nahi hai aur tumhe koi force kar raha hai ane ko to kabhi mat ana  admission lene se pahle acchi trah pata kar lena Iss baare me Agar aur ko help Chaiye

Dear sir,


This to bring to your kind notice that I had joined as centre manager at Arena Animation 1st floor Sector-18 NOIDA in 2008 . Therefore I was working as business partner during the year¬†2013-14¬†and¬†2014-15. There was no business loss upto¬†2014-15¬†and the office had been functioning satisfactionly. Due to good performance at sector 18,NOIDA centre,I was forced to take franchise of Greater Noida centre and I was accessed to pay Rs.7.25 lacs. I was also threatened that if I don't¬† take up Greater Noida centre, I will have to face the consequences at Sector-18,Noida centre. In the mean while I had a severe attack of Tumour in the month of January 2015 and could not attend to the centre till 17 March 2015 during this Period of my absence the company¬† Audit took place. Audit report shows a no.of irregularities after completion of audit the company did not renew the franchise agreement thus restricting further admitions and there by resulting into prospective losses with the intention of renewal of contract I contacted mr.Anuj Kakar and mr.Easo Thampy Mathew and assured them that I would take all steps to rectify the irregularities pointed out in the audit report but despite this the contract was not renewed . Non-Renewal of agreement has resulted into huge losses to me. Further the agreement was signed to some other party in the same building on the 7th floor this further worsened the position of mine the situation is now so worsened that I am not in a position to earn my livelihood
Sir, I am the soul earner in my family which consist of my mother and my one school going son in the circumstances I request you to intervene and shall be great full if you please arrange to impress upon the company to renew the franchise agreement so that I may earn my livelihood.
Agreement for Sector-18 centre was not renewed by the company with the intention of harrassing me.
I trust you and I am sure that you will not let injustice .Waiting for reply¬†
Thanks and Regards

I recently made a website from scratch and it is currently using just css for image popups on desktop but the images are still getting loaded on mobile and it is slowing down that page considerably. Could I use this technique but add the images to the DOM only if the screen is a certain size to avoid them loading on mobile? If so, how would I add the images dynamically? Would I create an array of strings that have each of the image sources and somehow iterate through, adding each source string to a corresponding src attribute?

2. Algorithm Concepts - Explaining the details of Machine Learning Algorithms (like this one). 
3. The Math You Should know - Subset of (2) with a ton of Math (Linear, Logistic Regression and Kernel Vids I made)
4. Papers and Discussions - Reading and explaining the concept math behind recent research papers in deep Learning, machine learning (Eg. Attention, Masked RCNN, CycleGANs vids)

I made explicit playlists of these videos, so check 'em out in the ""playlist"" section. add the entire playlist for some continuous quality content ;)

Dude here is some advise before do another video right it all down on paper and read it out loud to yourself. Think about what you are teaching and see if what you are trying to convey makes any sense and does it impart the important need to know information. Teach as if your students are all idiots that know nothing about what you are teaching and define terms without using that term. Also every aspect of what you teach needs to answer the following six questions. Who, What, When, Where, Why and how! If what you are trying to say does not then you have left most  of your students behind. And yes I know you are no teacher but if you are going to post shit at least do it right.",0,

Here you can simply use an in-built function shutil.copy
shutil.copyfileobj(fsrc, fdst[, length])
: 
-----------------------------------------------------------

Copy the contents of the file-like object fsrc to the file-like object fdst. The integer length, if given, is the buffer size. In particular, a negative length value means to copy the data without looping over the source data in chunks; by default the data is read in chunks to avoid uncontrolled memory consumption. Note that if the current file position of the fsrc object is not 0, only the contents from the current file position to the end of the file will be copied.

shutil.copyfile(src, dst)
:
---------------------------------------
Copy the contents (no metadata) of the file named src to a file named dst. dst must be the complete target file name; look at shutil.copy() for a copy that accepts a target directory path. If src and dst are the same files, Error is raised. The destination location must be writable; otherwise, an IOError exception will be raised. If dst already exists, it will be replaced. Special files such as character or block devices and pipes cannot be copied with this function. src and dst are path names given as strings.

As of 10/03/2019, If you are following along this tutorial. ""container.div"" won't give you the div with the ""item-info"" class. Instead it will give you the div with the ""item-badges"" class. This is because the latter occurs before the former. When you access any tag with the dot(.) operator, it will just return the first instance of that tag. I had a problem following this along until i figured this out. To solve this just use the ""find()"" method to find exactly the div which contains the information that you want. For e.g.   divWithInfo = containers[0].find(""div"",""item-info"")",1,

I just cant grasp it. I cant find anywhere what the terms in the algorithm means.

Like, what would Mt and Vt mean? I know its the Mean and a Variance but I don't understand what you mean by that. And what does T stand for?
You also said that it adapts and ""learns"" the learning rate, making it a parameter instead of a hyper one. Then why is it in the math? Is that N the initial learning rate that I have to tweak?

All I can understand is the e (realy small number just so it doesn't divide by 0) and Beta, being another hyperparamter. And O, being each weight or bias, but I don't know what the Ts stand for 

Thanks for all the videos btw. Youre videos usually don't get a lot into detail, but its from them that I acknowledge that these new optimizing functions and so on exist in the first place. Usually I just run off to google looking and learning for myself the details of what u show on the videos, but in this case I cant learn anywhere and Im desperate lol.

13393,"7:46 Well I don't think the pooling layer is used to get insensitive about the locations of the objects in an image. The convolutional layer can already do that since the convolutional operation is actually a pixel window going from location to location until all locations are considered under the set stride. The pooling layer is used to semantically merge similar features into one, like in the max pooling example used in this video, you can see the image is partitioned into 4 parts and in each part, the max number is preserved. The max number can semantically represent a feature in that region. It's more like image compression but we have preserved the key features of this object in this image. Feeding this pooled image into the neural net could be more efficient.",1,

Unfortunately too often ML is presented as a magical solution by software sellers and I've seen many dangerous attempts to use it blindly for manufacturing decision making. It's not a way to skip our professional responsibility... we have to do our homework and understand  what's happening, why it's happening, identify the sources of variations (and address them).

13563,"Hey,
I am in a competitive programming team. I have to say that I don't know the programming industry very well as I am still a student but I believe that there is still a lot of value in these competitions.

First of all competitive programming is not about quick programming but rather about problem solving and algorithm design. In order to measure one's skill the element of time is used but not a crucial factor.

Furthermore it can prepare someone for university as there is a lot of math involved.

I see your point that being able to program very quickly and dirty is not at all useful and can even be a disadvantage in a real job. There I agree with you, it's not suited for interviews. But in my journey of these competitions i have made a lot of friends with the same interests and it made algorithms very accessible to me. In a computer science degree, there are lots of classes involving algorithms and I can safely say that it prepared me very good for those.

So competitive programming is not good for real life development but for the more mathematical side and computer science it's very useful, it's not about speed but about algorithm design and last but not least it's great fun.

14438,"To Whom willing to respond: I installed Ubuntu 19.04 on a separate physical 750GB Drive attached to a Win10Pro Dual Xeon E5-2683 Workstation I had laying around. I thought I would do the Dual Boot thing so a Flight Sim buddy got me started but really does not have time to teach me Linux so, I found this site. Cool! Before I delve in too deep I need some specific advice about what should be a straight forward issue. Ok, after installing 19.04 from a USB stick I now have Ubunto installed. The boot sequence starts at GRUB and If I don't choose Windows then Ubunto auto starts and I arrive the desktop with no login required. Ok so far? Good. What I don't understand or know how to fix is the ""ME"" the only user on the PC. Let me explain. When I go to terminal the Prompt reads ""mrscotte@DX:~$"" From desktop /settings I see user ""Mike Scott"" and 5 dots in the password field. Ok. First, I don't recall setting up either of these much less the password so How to I make sense of this or do I just reinstall ubuntu and pay attention to what is ask of me along the way? What is confusing is I tried the reset the password through terminal mode and it does not Recognixe Mike Scott as a user. WHAT! Can't be! So from recovery Root,  I tried the passwd routin and nothing so I tried this "" cat /etc/passwd"" and I see ""mrscotte:x:1000:1000:Mike Scott,,,:/home/mrscotte:bin/bash""  From what little I know about linux this looks like the same user with a difference name. Not sure how this happened, when or why but I need to reset my passwd. I can set it for mrscotte but the only place I see mrscotte is in T-Mode. Desktop| Settings I see USER Mike Scott and the passwd I used for mrscotte does not work, WHAT AM I MISSISNG? If you can help me fix this small issues I will not have to wipe out this install and start over. Thanks and sorry for the long post. I don't know where to turn for help.",0,

I just have 2 questions: I actually downloaded the same data set and tried the exact same code, I had 2 problems:
1) The most similar movie to Avatar is how to train your dragon with only 0,46 of correlation. The movie Guadians of the Galaxy which was supposed to be the most similar movie to Avatar is only 15% correlated to the latest. I don't understand why. 
2) The other problem I faced is much simpler, I actually work in Colab and I tried the code: 
i=0
for movie in sorted_similar_movies:
    get_title_from_index(movie[0])
    i=i+1
    if i>50: 
      break

index 0 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 0

14827,"Here's what I know. It's an example of how they teach us things in education that are clearly false if only people would apply critical thinking. Weight, Mass and Density are things we really cannot quantify. Mass is the amount of particles in an object or medium. Density is a measure of how densely packed together those particles are in that object or medium. Volume is the amount of space particles take up within a given area. We don't really have the technology to measure mass or density directly so we use indirect methods for general purposes. (No one admits this, I'm saying it because it's True.. continue and you'll see) How do they do that? First they need to find the mass which they do with a scale by measuring weight and then with a graduated cylinder with water to measure that volume displacement. Think about that in contrast to Mass's definition above. That is Not a measure of the amount of particles (or molecules) in an object or medium as is Mass's definition so that's a false way to calculate Mass ! - but that's what they use. Then how do they find the Density? They divide that false mass by the volume ! They come up with a number based on a false measurement and like Mass, where no particles have ever actually been counted, those particles have never been measured for density ! Let that sink in. Anyway now that you have both of these you can calculate Weight which is Mass x Density.. which is Hog Wash because you derived it from two false variables as I have just shown. Does a scale take into account density x mass to arrive at the weight? No ! Scales do not require that information before they can measure the weight. The point is the formulas, definitions and methods used to derive these variables do not agree with each other and they describe different things ! Therefore these should not be taught as such! It's Incorrect ! They want us to believe in a mass whose particles were never counted, density of particles that was never measured and weight that could not possibly be calculated from those two clearly False variables. - I'll add that what they teach above is also circular logic. They start with a Scale First for Mass and therefore Density so when they expect you to calculate weight from mass x density they are essentially having you work Backward to arrive at an already known variable.. the weight you measured before! It's deceptive and wrong.",0,

You demonstrated how to manually and iteratively (without using simple maths such as combination formulae) look for number of ways to colour the graph with given set of colors. As per your own declaration , it falls in type 1 problem but a printing press only needs to know whether or not they can colour the graph with given set of finite N number of colors (if mixing is not allowed). That is clearly your Type 2 N-colouring decision problem!

If mixing is allowed, then they don't even need to know anything. Press created the map so they know already how many bisections they made of the graph which will be the number of times they will have to sequentially print each colour one after another. And also since they can mix the colors to make infinite shades of colors, they don't need to find out how many ways to fill colors in these bisections. They will start with 1 colour and then keep filling another shade after another shade till it is completely filled. They would already know how many fills they need to do, as again they know already the number of vertices/bisections in the map.",0,

Definition - What does Computer Architecture mean?

Computer architecture is a specification detailing how a set of software and hardware technology standards interact to form a computer system or platform. In short, computer architecture refers to how a computer system is designed and what technologies it is compatible with.

As with other contexts and meanings of the word architecture, computer architecture is likened to the art of determining the needs of the user/system/technology, and creating a logical design and standards based on those requirements.

Techopedia explains Computer Architecture

A very good example of computer architecture is von Neumann architecture, which is still used by most types of computers today. This was proposed by the mathematician John von Neumann in 1945. It describes the design of an electronic computer with its CPU, which includes the arithmetic logic unit, control unit, registers, memory for data and instructions, an input/output interface and external storage functions.

There are three categories of computer architecture:

System Design: This includes all hardware components in the system, including data processors aside from the CPU, such as the graphics processing unit and direct memory access. It also includes memory controllers, data paths and miscellaneous things like multiprocessing and virtualization.
Instruction Set Architecture (ISA): This is the embedded programming language of the central processing unit. It defines the CPU's functions and capabilities based on what programming it can perform or process. This includes the word size, processor register types, memory addressing modes, data formats and the instruction set that programmers use.
Microarchitecture: Otherwise known as computer organization, this type of architecture defines the data paths, data processing and storage elements, as well as how they should be implemented in the ISA.",1,
15078,"The purpose is to design a computer that maximizes performance while keeping power consumption in check, costs low relative to the amount of expected performance, and is also very reliable. For this, many aspects are to be considered which includes instruction set design, functional organization, logic design, and implementation. The implementation involves integrated circuit design, packaging, power, and cooling. Optimization of the design requires familiarity with compilers, operating systems to logic design, and packaging",1,

15093,"Hello sir,
I tried to derive the formula to calculate total number of states (say x) satisfying 

{n(a)}mod(c) > {n(b)}mod(d)  ...eq(1) 

using arithmetic progression approach i.e.

let c = d = 4

i.e.

O  X  X  X
O  O  X  X
O  O  O  X
O  O  O  O

here the X's are the states which are satisfying the above condition.

So we have (c-1) states in first row, (c-2) in next and so on upto (d-1)...

So we have an a.p.

By evaluating this a.p. I got :-

Number of states satisfying this condition:

x = (d-1)(2c-d)/2

My question is :-

x can't be negative so we must have (2c-d) > 0

But there are some cases where this condition is not true still there exists states which satisfies eq(1). Eg :-

c = 6 & d = 14

please tell me if i am doing anything wrong and how can we form a generalised formula.

Then you are able to use the tag names as objects of the link soup variable.

        for link in soup.find_all('article', {'class':'product_pod'}):

15447,"If the transaction node is a flat earther, does it loose the trust then?",0,
15448,"There is so much innacuracy in this video, you might want to take it down.

1) You claim that transactions are not grouped into 'blocks' using a merkle tree. Actually they are. All the transactions are grouped in 'ledgers' which are a bit like blocks but contain the entire state of all accounts. You can see the implementation of the Merkle tree in the code here: https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/381a1b948b06d9526cc73f14cfc69635fabf8605/src/ripple/shamap/README.md

2) You claim that the XRP Ledger is not a blockchain. This is incorrect. Each ledger contains in the header a hash (fingerprint) of the previous ledger. This creates a chain of states you can use to validate the integrity of the ledger. This is what prevents the rewriting of history. Details of the header here: https://developers.ripple.com/ledgers.html

3) You claim that validators validate the transactions. This is a common misconception. The validators are not validating the transactions themselve (each and every node does this, just like with Bitcoin). They are merely validating the order of transactions. ie to solve the double spend problem

4) Freezing transactions. No, Ripple cannot freeze any transactions. You have misrepresented the freeze feature. The freeze feature only allows the *issuer* of the IOUs (ie the gateway) to freeze the trust of the IOU. Just like any centralised exchange can freeze the IOUs they implicitly give you in return for you depositing your cryptocurrency. Just it is documented on the ledger itself.",1,

Hmmm, I am wondering about that.. But of course, it will take about few years when genius is about to figure it out... Thus all accounts and ripples are all stolen... Good luck on this... Should we invest XRP on this? Hmmmm, so many questions... Unsure how to answer them...",1,

15457,"i dont know how old your video is but gateways are not longer used by the ripple network. Also the freezing was only possible with gateways. A gateways can freeze a balance, Ripple cant, they can ask the gateway to froze the asset.

Earlier in this video, Andrew Ng mentioned the squared (h(x)-y) cost function should be replaced by the log(h(x)) cost function in order to make the graph of the cost function convex.

But in the last slide, he still uses the squared (h(x)-y) cost function in the Gradient Descent function for Logistic Regression. Shouldn't it be replaced by the log(h(x)) cost function?

Anyone has the same question?",1,

agar sir hum ""class A "" ke function ""f1"" ke argument me ""int "" type ki value pass kare
or ""class B"" ke function "" f2 "" ke argument me ""double"" (any other data type) type ki value pass kare 
to dono class ""A"" and ""B"" ke results pass ho jayenge


Isme humne arguments ki length same hi rhene di
and function ka naam bhi same hi rhene diya
but data type change kar dia.


conclusion : Phele hume overriding se sirf child class ka hi result mil raha tha 
                      but ab hame dono class(parent and child ) class ka result mil raha he

- Brute Force approach finds all the possible solutions and selects desired solution per given the constraints.
- Dynamic Programming also uses Brute Force approach to find the OPTIMUM solution, either maximum or minimum.
- Backtracking also uses Brute Force approach but to find ALL the solutions.
- Solutions to the Backtracking problems can be represented as State-Space Tree.
- The constrained applied to find the solution is called Bounding function.
- Backtracking follows Depth-First Search method.
- Branch and Bound is also a Brute Force approach, which uses Breadth-First Search method.",1,

I have a doubt: for a mass balance where I want to find the best k:

And I want to use the function ""fit"" in MATLAB. I tried both ways (linear and non-linear, setting the method in the options) and it gave me different results for k.
What would be the most correct result?
Since linearizing is one extra step, does it input more error to the results?

17169,But can it be applied to fantasy football? Need better-optimized line-ups.,1,
17170,"I have a few questions and found mistakes:
0) The number 0.4 is not the probability of home team winning but the probability of us winning the bet. For the number 0.4 it means that we do bets even worse than a coin flip.
1) How did you get a graph shown on 8:25. Your GitHub has a different graph
2) How did you get a graph in your GitHub: https://github.com/llSourcell/sports_betting_with_reinforcement_learning/blob/master/optimalpolicy.png
The code from your GitHub: https://github.com/llSourcell/sports_betting_with_reinforcement_learning/blob/master/value_iteration_for_sports.py produces different results

There are also two mistakes in your code:
3) while delta > theta:
This turns out to be not enough, try to do 500 iterations instead:
for i in range(500): 
and you will get substantially different results

4) for bet in range(0, ... # Minimum bet should be 1
Try doing 500 iterations (the point #3) and you will see that almost everywhere optimal policy becomes to take zero bets.

17249,"First of all i appreciate your effort to explain competitive programming and hackathons.
You mis-communicate the difference of two, You underestimated competitive programming in videos
you made 2 videos but still could not explained it well. May be you have not enough knowledge of it.
 Let me explain this
1). Competitive Programming (Or Coding Challenge in this Context):- It is simple form of contest where you have given problem statement  and you only need build the code (Not a App or Website) . It is just 100-200 lines of code. It has some input and you need to find out its output on the console (like printf("" "") in C ). Competitive Programming is not just first step in hackathons. It can get you job in Google, Facebook without building a App or Website. Some of contents are
    a). Google Code Jam ( https://code.google.com/codejam/past-contests ) Google has yearly competitive programming 
           contest (not hackathon) which has some 5-6 rounds. From round 1 to final it has not even 1 question of building a App 
           or Website, All question are in form of explained above. Open the link of past contests of code jam to see past 
          questions
    b). Facebook's 'HackerCup' exactly same structure 
    C). Websites like HackerEarth, HackerRank conducts Hiring challenges for different companies which is pure competitive 
           programming(Not Hackathon)
    d). Vist HackerEarth, HackerRank, CodeChef for competitive Programming Quetions

   BOTTOMLINE IS COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING IS NOT ONLY THE FIRST ROUND OF HACKATHON. IT CAN GIVE A JOB IN 
   GOOGLE,FACEBOOK AND OTHER PRODUCT BASED COMPANIES. IT JUST NEED STRONG KNOWLEDGE OF DSA AND ANY ONE 
   PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE (ANDROID OR WEB DEVELOPMENT etc. IS NOT REQUIRED FOR 'GOOGLE CODEJAM' AND 
   'FACEBOOK HAKCERCUP' etc. BUT KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE OF SOME TECHNOLOGIES IS REQUIRED FOR JOB )

2). Hackathon :- You Explained it well in video. But not every hackathon has 1st round as coding challenge.",1,

Here's a way to simplify the loop in pop():

        // Bubble down the top element to the right spot
        int pos = 0;
        int least;
        do {
            least = pos;
            int leftChild = pos * 2 + 1;
            int rightChild = leftChild + 1;
            if (leftChild < size && heap[leftChild] < heap[pos]) least = leftChild;
            if (rightChild < size && heap[rightChild] < heap[pos]) least = rightChild;
        } while (least != pos);

I would also factor out parent()/left()/right()",0,

Implementing Stack using Priority_queue:

https://algorithmsinfinite.blogspot.com/2018/10/implementing-stack-using-priorityqueue.html",1,
18373,"Hi. I think your code of pop() function isn't good.
For example, if you have the heap=(4,3,2,1) - your code swaps TWICE the pair(3,1).
You need to change 3rd and 4th rows of the function code.
Also I think it would be better to have the loop block as ""while (pos<size)"".
I gets one more iteration (leftChild, rightChild>size in this case) and you can do something with heap[pos] which is bubbled up on the previous iteration.",0,

18376,"Great video! The explanations plus the live code make it very easy to understand. I do have a possible errors though.. inside pop() method, heap[size - 1] is copied and then left as is, which i suppose is fine due to size ""shrinks"", but shouldn't it be set to 0 for cleanliness? Also, the size doesn't decrease until the while loop is finished, so shouldn't the while loop condition be (pos < size / 2 - 1)?",1,

The maximum of a sigmoid is exactly 0.25. f(x) = sigmoid(x). f''(x) = sigmoid(x) ( 1 - 2 sigmoid(x) ) ( 1 - sigmoid(x) ) = 0 when sigmoid derivative is maximum. This can only happen when sigmoid(x) = 0.5. f'(x) = sigmoid(x) ( 1 - sigmoid(x)) implies the maximum derivative is 1 quarter. The worst case is not when the derivative is maximum 4 times in a row. The worst case is when the gradient is so low it is treated as zero within machine precision. The graph of the derivative of relu should not be continuous.,0,

19036,"I wonder what you have planned for quality control. (I guess I¬¥ll find out :) 
The assumption that native speakers can write with correct grammar or even spelling (or explain grammar) is in most roman and germanic languages a dangerous one. I have found the same to be true of Japanese to some extent. I had to meet several Japanese before I met one, who could explain where the ""ga"" particle in ""Nihongo ga sukoshi dekimas"" came from. (Sorry for the romaji, writing skills are a real problem :) So I think it would be better to have several editors, like with bitcoin, where you have to get five confirmations, before you know you have made your payment.
I like that you are keeping it simple (the twitterbot setup) and maybe I¬¥m thinking to far ahead. But this seems to me to be one of the big features that would make it dependable. It would also mean that on average, I¬¥d correct like 3 sentences to get one corrected, so my investment and dedication would be different. Therefore it would be best to start with this, to get the community that has that level of commitment. Also I¬¥d like to know WHY something is wrong. The spelling mistakes you show in the video are not really relevant, because a spell-checker will get those out for me. I don¬¥t need a person for that.",0,

Telstra will be able to flick a switch.. maybe not 1 year.. even if its 3 years, and potentially have millions of driverless' taxi's by the time the sun comes up the next day.   Measure that gap in your analysis, and then you can see its Tesla by a long margin.",1,
19304,"I still think it is impressive that humans have so few accidents considering we have only two sensors to visually observe the world with, that also have poor depth perception after a couple of meters. Not only that but those sensors only point one way, forward, although we use mirrors to provide access in other directions it is still with the same sensors. We map the world in real time, we identify hazards, we figure out where we need to go, we react to changes, we don't need to have been somewhere or have real time maps to navigate (just good signage which is something of a problem these days). I think we do really well considering we do all that while physically controlling and operating the vehicle, listening to music or talking to passengers. To be fair, it is those last two (and other distractions) that can cause problems, along with the fact we tire, get distracted and otherwise have things on our minds not related to driving at that moment, at which point we find out we have drifted into the on-coming traffic...


Will the computer be able to deal with an animal running out in front of the vehicle because it didn't see it through the surrounding bushes? Or a pedestrian that isn't looking as they approach a crossing (probably has nose in phone) and then turns and walks out just as the car approaches. And even if it does avoid that hazard, it still may have to swerve in order to do it, that could lead it into a tree or a gaggle of people or out into other traffic. While the computer may be able to react much faster than a human, it still has a ton and a half (or more) of metal and meat to stop/move, and inertia is universal for both human and automatic drivers.

I ask because it seems that the policy was set to have the same length with the environment's state, but the problem was to get to ""G"" as fast as possible, wasn't it?

2. I looked up the gym's documentation, and tried it on my own, and it seemed to me that the attributes nA, nS and P are not standard attributes of an environment. I see that you used these attributes quite naturally without having to explain what they are, could you explain why the code still runs, please?
